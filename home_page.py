                    The Return Period (also known as the Recurrence Interval) is the estimated average time interval between rainfall events of a certain intensity or magnitude.
                    For example, a 50-year rainfall event is one that has a 2% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

                    Many people think a ‚Äú50-year return period‚Äù means the event happens only once every 50 years.
                    That‚Äôs not true.

                    Instead, it means:

                    1. The probability of that event occurring in any single year is 2%
                    2. It could happen two years in a row, or even more than once in the same year
                    3. Or it might not occur for 50 years‚Äîit's about probability, not prediction

                    It‚Äôs similar to rolling a dice: just because a 6 has a 1-in-6 chance doesn‚Äôt mean it only appears every 6 rolls.

                    With this calculator, you can:
                    1. Input your historical rainfall data
                    2. Analyze statistical properties of the data
                    3. Estimate the Return Periods using various statistical methods:
                        - Normal
                        - Log Normal
                        - Pearson III
                        - Log Pearson III
                        - Gumbel distributions
                    4. Visualize the return period curved for better interpretation
                    5. Perform statistical tests to validate the data quality using:
                        - RAPS (Rescaled Adjusted Partial Sums)
                        - Trendlessness Test
                        - Homogenity Test (F-Test & t-Test)
                        - Inlier-Outlier Test
                        - Chi-Square Test
                        - Smirnov-Kolmogorov Test
                        - RMSE and MAPE Metrics

                This is a **trial version** of the Rainfall Return Period Calculator, developed as part of an ongoing project to support better **water resources management in Indonesia**.  
                Currently, the app allows users to upload rainfall data and perform **probability distribution analysis**.

                üîß **Future plans include**:
                - üåßÔ∏è Adding **Losses Curve Number (SCS-CN) method**
                - üåä Generating **flow hydrographs**
                - üöÄ A **monetization model** (e.g. subscription access) to help sustain development and drive further innovation
